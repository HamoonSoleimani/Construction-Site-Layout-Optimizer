## Key Components (Code Structure Overview)

*   `SiteElement`: Represents individual facilities with properties like position, size, color, and behavior rules.
*   `PathPlanner`: Employs an A* algorithm to find and manage vehicle/pedestrian routes, considering obstacles and constraints. It generates an obstruction grid and smooths paths.
*   `OptimizationEngine`: Orchestrates the layout process using Simulated Annealing. It creates initial layouts, evaluates layout quality against defined objectives and constraints, and iteratively seeks better arrangements.
*   `SiteCanvas`: The interactive 2D visualization widget. It handles drawing of the site, elements, routes, grid, and supports user interactions like panning, zooming, element selection, and movement.
*   `ElementPropertiesWidget`: A panel for viewing and editing the detailed properties of a currently selected `SiteElement`.
*   `SpaceRequirementsWidget`: Allows users to define the area needed for each type of facility, either directly or based on personnel counts.
*   `ConstraintsWidget`: Provides UI for users to set various layout constraints (e.g., minimum distances, crane reach, safety buffers).
*   `OptimizationControlWidget`: Allows users to configure parameters for the Simulated Annealing algorithm and choose an overall optimization strategy (which adjusts scoring weights).
*   `DisplayOptionsWidget`: A panel with checkboxes to control the visibility of different visual elements on the `SiteCanvas`.
*   `OptimizationWorker (QThread)`: Executes the computationally intensive optimization process in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive.
*   `ConstructionSiteOptimizerApp (QMainWindow)`: The main application window. It integrates all UI components, manages project data (loading/saving), and orchestrates the interaction between the UI, the `OptimizationEngine`, and other modules.

## Configuration

### Default Element Definitions
The application uses pre-defined defaults for site elements, their properties, space requirements, and layout constraints. These are typically found as global Python dictionaries within the source code (e.g., `SITE_ELEMENTS`, `DEFAULT_SPACE_REQUIREMENTS`, `DEFAULT_CONSTRAINTS`, `DEFAULT_PERSONNEL_CONFIG`). These defaults are used when creating a new project or resetting configurations.

`SITE_ELEMENTS` defines for each facility type:
*   `color`: Default display color.
*   `movable`: Whether it can be moved by the optimizer or user.
*   `priority`: Influences initial placement order.
*   `placeable_inside_building`: If true, this element can be notionally placed within the main building's footprint.
*   `resizable`: If true, its dimensions can change.
*   `aspect_ratio`: Preferred width-to-height ratio if resizable.
*   `fixed_width`, `fixed_height`: Specific dimensions if not resizable.

### Element Properties (SiteElement class attributes)
Each `SiteElement` instance in the layout stores:
*   `name`: The type of the facility (e.g., 'Contractor Office').
*   `x`, `y`: Top-left position in world coordinates (meters).
*   `width`, `height`: Dimensions in meters.
*   `rotation`: Angle in degrees.
*   `color`: `QColor` for display.
*   `movable`: Boolean indicating if it can be moved.
*   `selected`: Boolean indicating if it's currently selected on the canvas.
*   `priority`, `placeable_inside_building`: (Inherited from type definition).
*   `is_placed_inside_building`: Boolean status.
*   `original_external_x, y, width, height, rotation`: Stores original geometry if temporarily moved inside a building.

### Project Files (`.slyp`)
*   Projects are saved in `.slyp` files, which are JSON-formatted text files.
*   These files store:
    *   Application version at the time of saving.
    *   Save date.
    *   Plot dimensions (width, height) and the main building's area ratio.
    *   All configured layout constraints.
    *   All defined space requirements, including any personnel-based configurations.
    *   A list of all site elements, including their name, position, dimensions, rotation, color, movability, selection state, and internal placement status.

### Application Settings
*   Window size, position, and the state of UI splitters are saved automatically using `QSettings`.
    *   These settings are stored based on `ORGANIZATION_NAME = "HamoonSoleimani"` and `APPLICATION_NAME = "ConstructionSiteOptimizer"`.
*   The file paths to the last opened/saved project and the last image export directory are also remembered across sessions.
